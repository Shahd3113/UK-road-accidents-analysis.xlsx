## 📈 Insights

1. **Seasonal Peaks:**  
   - Highest accidents occurred in **November** and **October** (25K+ incidents).  
   - Lowest in **February** (under 19K).  
   - Suggests increased risk in late autumn and early winter due to reduced daylight and weather conditions.

   - One-way streets showed the lowest average (1.61).

3. **Road Surface Impact:**  
   - Most accidents occurred on **dry roads** (135K), but **wet and icy roads** had **higher severity** (more serious/fatal injuries).

4. **Vehicle Type Risk:**  
   - **Cars** were involved in over 153K incidents.  
   - **Motorcycles >500cc** showed the highest risk among two-wheelers.  
   - **Pedal cycles and horses** had few accidents, possibly due to lower road exposure.
